# GitHub Action Naming Standards

This document outlines the conventions and best practices for naming GitHub workflow files,
organizing workflow directories, and structuring workflow definitions.
It is intended to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across all repository workflows.

## Workflow Naming Standards:

### Workflow Name

`ddd: [XXXX] <my-21-char-name>`

### Workflow Name Description

- 3-digit prefix (000 to 999)

  | Prefix |     Category / Description     |        Notes / Subcategory        |
  |--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | 000    | User-centric workflows         | Sorted by priority/use            |
  | 100    | Operational workflows          | Manual-run RE flows               |
  | 200    | Pull Request based checks      | Triggered on pull request events  |
  | 300    | Trigger-based `main` workflows |                                   |
  | 400    | TBD                            |                                   |
  | 500    | TBD                            |                                   |
  | 600    | TBD                            |                                   |
  | 700    | AI Helpers                     | Helpers for AI workflows          |
  | 800    | Reusable workflows             |                                   |
  | 900    | Cron tasks                     | Prefixed by 900 to sort to bottom |

- Followed by `: ` (colon and a space)

- Followed by square-bracket notation `[XXXX] ` followed by a space

  | Workflow Code |                                      Description                                      |
  |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `[USER]`      | Called by user directly via workflow dispatch                                         |
  | `[FLOW]`      | Triggered through some manner (PR Target, Branch Push, or Tag Push)                   |
  | `[CALL]`      | Reusable workflow (`workflow_call`)                                                   |
  | `[CRON]`      | Scheduled workflow (`schedule`)                                                       |
  | `[DISP]`      | Internal dispatchable (workflow dispatch triggered by other workflows, not end users) |

- Followed by the name of the workflow, maximum of 21 characters

- Workflow Naming Notes:

  - Use proper casing
  - Separator used should be spaces

### Example Workflow Name

Example: Suppose we have a user-centric workflow that is the highest priority workflow in the repo. This workflow is
for performing status checks.

Name of the Workflow: `000: [USER] Status Checks`

| Numeric Prefix | `: ` | Workflow Code | Name of Workflow |
|----------------|------|---------------|------------------|
| `000`          | `: ` | `[USER]`      | `Status Checks`  |

## File Naming Standards:

### File Name

`ddd-xxxx-<my-30-char-file-name>.yaml`

### File Name Description

- 3-digit prefix (000 to 999)

  | Prefix |     Category / Description     |        Notes / Subcategory        |
  |--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

- Followed by a hyphen `-`

- Followed by the workflow name, maximum of 30 characters

- Followed by`.yaml`

- File Naming Notes:

  - All letters in filename should be lowercase
  - Separator used should be a hyphen
  - No special characters are allowed in filename

### Example File Name

Example: Suppose we have a user-centric workflow that is the highest priority workflow in the repo. This workflow is
for performing status checks. Note hyphens are used as separators in the workflow.

Name of the Workflow File: `000-user-status-checks.yaml`

| Numeric Prefix | Workflow Code | Name of Workflow | File Extension |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| `000`          | `user`        | `status-checks`  | `.yaml`        |
